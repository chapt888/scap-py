# Inventory System Frontend Application

## Project Overview
- **Project Name** SCAP Frontend Application
- **Objective:** Develop a frontend application in Python to interact with an inventory system in a MySQL database.
- **Technology Stack:**
  - Frontend: `customtkinter` for UI
  - Backend: MySQL database
- **Structure:** The application will have a sidebar with a navigation menu and a main content area that changes based on the selected menu item.

## 1. Project Structure
Outline the directory structure and the naming conventions for the `.py` files.

### Directory Structure
- `/db` - for database connection and queries
- `/ui` - for UI components
- `/util` - for utility functions
- `/content_areas` - for different content areas

### Naming Conventions
- Files: `snake_case` (e.g., `database_connection.py`)
- Classes/Functions: `CamelCase` for classes and `snake_case` for functions

## 2. Database Connection
Details about setting up the module for database interactions.

### `db_connection.py`
- Function to connect to the MySQL database
- Function to close the database connection
- Query execution functions

## 3. UI Components
Design and development of the user interface.

### `sidebar.py`
- Create a vertical navigation menu
- Buttons for different inventory sections

### `main_content_area.py`
- Logic to update the content based on the selected menu item

## 4. Content Area Management
Implementation of content area loading and display logic.

### Content Area Files (`/content_areas`)
- `products.py`
- `orders.py`
- `customers.py`
- *... (and more based on the inventory sections)*

## 5. Modularity and Code Organization
Ensure code is organized, modular, and each `.py` file is self-contained.

### Best Practices
- Use classes and functions to encapsulate behavior
- Ensure clear interfaces between different modules
- Write reusable and well-documented code

## 6. Development Plan
A checklist or timeline to manage the development process.

### Week 1:
- [ ] Finalize the project structure
- [ ] Set up the database connection module

### Week 2:
- [ ] Develop the basic UI layout
- [ ] Implement sidebar functionality

### Week 3:
- [ ] Develop content area for `products`
- [ ] Develop content area for `orders`

*... (and so on, until all sections are complete)*

## 7. Testing & Quality Assurance
Plan for testing the application to ensure it meets requirements and quality standards.

### Unit Tests
- Test database connection
- Test UI components in isolation

### Integration Tests
- Test the application flow from UI interaction to database updates

## 8. Deployment
Plan for deploying the application, including any required environment setup.

### Deployment Steps
- Environment setup
- Dependency installation
- Application launch instructions
